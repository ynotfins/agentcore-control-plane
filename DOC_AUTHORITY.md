# Document Authority Index — AgentCore Control Plane

**Source authority:** `D:\github\agentcore-control-plane`
**Bifrost runtime:** `H:\AgentRuntime\bifrost` (not design authority)
**Compatibility/live-ops evidence only:** `D:\MCP-Control-Plane`
**Updated:** 2026-07-20 (cross-ref reconciliation vs BLUEPRINT.md: memory live, M6 leases + OpenRouter JIT bridge, Cherry re-enroll pending; architecture unchanged)

This file is the document hierarchy. It tells a new agent what to read, what is authoritative, and what must not be followed as current instructions.

---

## Authority hierarchy (one chain; nothing else overrides it)

1. `PROJECT_ANCHOR.md` — stable constitution and non-negotiable boundaries
2. `DOC_AUTHORITY.md` — this file: exact read order and classification
3. `BLUEPRINT.md` — locked goal, architecture, storage roles, lossless guarantees, and Milestone exit criteria (operator-approved; change requires explicit approval)
4. `CONTEXT_BLOCK.md` — current mutable system state and implementation progress
5. `docs/memory-platform/MEMORY_PLATFORM_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` — detailed Milestone execution guidance (derives from BLUEPRINT.md; BLUEPRINT wins on conflicts)
6. Current Bifrost contracts, ops runbooks, and handoffs (`contracts/bifrost-upstream-mcp-registry.json`, `contracts/agentcore-gateway-client.json`, `docs/bifrost/`, `docs/operations/OPENROUTER_MCP.md`, `docs/operations/AUTONOMOUS_WORKFLOW_AND_STUDIO.md`, `docs/operations/DORMANT_MCP_CAPABILITY_CATALOG.md`, plus current handoffs under `docs/handoffs/` — use the newest dated handoff for live status; the 2026-07-12 Bifrost handoff remains historical cutover evidence)
7. `D:\ChaosCentral-Current-Build\DOC_AUTHORITY.md` — machine-fact authority (hardware, drives, installed software, runtime snapshots)

No other root or docs file may silently override this chain. If a document conflicts with a higher level, the higher level wins and the document must be reconciled or reclassified.

`D:\github\memory-context-database` contains supporting corpus/template planning (`DOCS_PLAN.md`, `DEPWIRE.md`) — it is **not** the controlling memory architecture.

---

## What to attach to a new chat

**Minimum (always attach):**

1. `PROJECT_ANCHOR.md` — immutable project constitution (includes Bifrost Gateway Override §0)
2. `DOC_AUTHORITY.md` — this hierarchy
3. `BLUEPRINT.md` — locked architecture, storage roles, lossless guarantees, Milestone exit criteria
4. `CONTEXT_BLOCK.md` — current system state + implementation progress
5. `contracts/bifrost-upstream-mcp-registry.json` — canonical upstream MCP registry
6. `contracts/agentcore-gateway-client.json` — single IDE gateway client contract
7. `docs/handoffs/AGENTCORE_BIFROST_GATEWAY_HANDOFF_2026-07-12.md` — Bifrost cutover handoff (historical; see newer handoffs for live status)
8. `MASTER_CONFIG_AND_PROMPT.md` — root setup guide with embedded reusable IDE prompt

## Unified IDE gateway install

| Doc | Use |
| -- | -- |
| `docs/bifrost/UNIFIED_GATEWAY_SETUP.md` | Per-IDE config blocks, add-server path, tool deny / profile VKs, Cursor troubleshooting |
| `docs/prompts/install-agentcore-gateway-in-ide.md` | Copy-paste agent prompt for any non-Swarm IDE |
| `docs/bifrost/CAPABILITY_PROFILES.md` | builder / reviewer / docs / operator VK surfaces |

## Experiments (isolated POCs; not production authority)

| Path | Notes |
| -- | -- |
| `experiments/bifrost-go-sdk-smoke/` | Bifrost Go SDK in-process OpenAI smoke. **Not** the Bifrost MCP Gateway. Remains an experiment only. See its README. |

## Evidence-only (read for facts; do not follow as instructions)

| File | Notes |
| -- | -- |
| `docs/evidence/PC-Master-Hardware-Software-Specs.md` | Authoritative PC hardware/software baseline; facts not instructions |
| `D:\MCP-Control-Plane` | Compatibility/live-ops evidence only |

## Historical / superseded (do not execute as current non-Swarm IDE baseline)

| File / claim | Why historical |
| -- | -- |
| Former `PROJECT_ANCHOR` §0 Native-First Swarm override as **mandatory IDE baseline** | Superseded for non-Swarm IDEs by Bifrost Gateway Override (2026-07-12) |
| Swarm-first mandatory MCP baseline (swarmrecall + swarmvault in every IDE) | Superseded for non-Swarm IDEs; Swarm remains a separate ecosystem |
| `database-plan.md` | **Historical schema evidence only.** 2026-06-30 PG16.6/Swarm-era design; replaced as implementation authority by `docs/memory-platform/MEMORY_PLATFORM_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`. Do not implement its schema, tool names, or Swarm memory planes. |
| `AGENT_DATABASE_BOOTSTRAP.md` | Historical PG16.6/Swarm-era database bootstrap (memory_append tools, `F:\AgentCore\agents_workspace` roots). Memory work reads the memory-platform execution plan instead. |
| `Global-memory-and-context-system-revised-2.md` | Research input that fed `CONTEXT_BLOCK.md`; wrong hardware/drive facts; its embedded "Memory Broker" prompt must never be executed. |
| `CONTEXT_BLOCK_AGENTCORE_SWARM_2026-06-30.md` | Frozen Swarm rollout status; Swarm-first baseline is not current non-Swarm policy |
| `docs/handoffs/AGENTCORE_SWARM_ROLLOUT_HANDOFF_2026-06-30.md` | Swarm rollout handoff; its P1–P9 phases must not be executed |
| `docs/RESTART_HANDOFF_20260626_AGENTCORE_FINAL_LEG.md` | Pre-Bifrost memory routing snapshot |
| Direct per-IDE full-server MCP blocks in older `MASTER_CONFIG_AND_PROMPT.md` | Moved to historical appendix; normal architecture is single gateway entry |
| `contracts/master-mcp-server-config.json`, `scripts/mcp_control_plane.py`, and legacy root `renderers/*.json` | Superseded for non-Swarm IDE setup by Bifrost contracts, `scripts/bifrost/render_bifrost_config.py`, and `renderers/gateway-clients/` |
| `docs/prompts/*-cleanup-prompt.md` direct-server/Swarm cleanup instructions | Remediation references only; normal non-Swarm IDE setup uses `install-agentcore-gateway-in-ide.md` / embedded master prompt |
| `global-memory-gateway` as IDE default memory route | Retired from mandatory baseline; non-Swarm path is `agentcore-memory` via gateway |
| `ECOSYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLEANUP_AUDIT.md`, `COMPLETION_REPORT.md`, `VALIDATION_REPORT.md` | Pre-2026-06-30 / `D:\MCP-Control-Plane` era |
| `reports/` (memory-architecture research pack) | Pre-decision research evidence; decisions locked in `CONTEXT_BLOCK.md` + `MILESTONES.md` |

> **Note:** `CONTEXT_BLOCK.md` was fully rewritten on 2026-07-12 and is now **current** (see Current-state table above). Only its pre-2026-06-30 content is historical.

All historical docs must not be run as instructions without current operator approval.

---

## What must NOT be treated as current instructions

- Any claim that `D:\MCP-Control-Plane` is the source/design authority
- Treating the Go SDK smoke as the workstation MCP gateway
- Requiring SwarmRecall/SwarmVault/SwarmClaw MCP in non-Swarm IDE configs
- Pasting the full upstream registry into each IDE instead of `agentcore-gateway`
- `agentcore_*` target gateway tools that do not exist yet (beyond current `agentcore-memory` / project-router surfaces)
- DB migration apply / live DDL outside the gates in `docs/memory-platform/MEMORY_PLATFORM_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (M1 backup/restore-test gates)
- Treating `database-plan.md` or `AGENT_DATABASE_BOOTSTRAP.md` as current database instructions
- Direct writes to `F:\AgentCore\database_cluster`, `F:\AgentCore\agentmemory`, or the active Obsidian vault
- Direct edits to live IDE configs under `C:\Users\ynotf\.*` without backup + approved prompt/ops
- `:65432` as an active runtime route
- Whole-drive filesystem MCP roots or Postgres credentials in IDE configs

---

## Current blockers (require explicit operator approval or follow-on work)

- `agentcore-memory` ten-tool surface is **live** (M3.002 / M4+; Cursor validated). Remaining memory-platform work is Milestone completion/ops hardening per `docs/memory-platform/MEMORY_PLATFORM_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and BLUEPRINT M5–M8 exit criteria — not “platform not landed”
- M6 PostgreSQL capability leases + Bifrost JIT VK bridge (`scripts/bifrost/jit_vk_bridge.py`) are **implemented** for exact OpenRouter tool groups; transitional `permitted_tools: ["*"]` wildcards remain on some non-OpenRouter servers until named inventories replace them
- Cherry Studio re-enrollment: live `mcp.servers=[]` as of 2026-07-20; quit Cherry and run `scripts/cherry/enroll_agentcore_gateway.py` (see `audits/CHERRY_GATEWAY_ENROLLMENT_2026-07-20.md`)
- `depwire-cloud` and `github-mcp` remain deferred/`enabled=false` until healthy verification
- Live IDE cutover completion evidence still incomplete for some clients (see Bifrost handoff / artifacts / IDE profiles)
